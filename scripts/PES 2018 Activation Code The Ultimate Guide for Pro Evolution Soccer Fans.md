- The easiest way to get the activation code is to buy the game from an official retailer or online store. You will receive the code either on a physical card or via email. You can then enter the code on your device and download the game.
- If you don't want to spend money on the game, you can try to find a free serial number or unlock key online. There are some websites that claim to offer such codes, but be careful as they might be scams or contain viruses. One website that seems to be reliable is [Smart Serials](https://smartserials.com/serials/Pro-Evolution-Soccer-2018-36152.htm) [^1^], where you can find a list of codes for PES 2018. However, you will need to verify that you are human and agree with their disclaimer before accessing the codes.
- Another option is to download a crack or a patch for the game that bypasses the activation process. This is not recommended as it might violate the terms of service of the game and cause legal issues. Moreover, cracked or patched games might not work properly or have bugs and glitches. It is better to play the game legally and enjoy its full features.
