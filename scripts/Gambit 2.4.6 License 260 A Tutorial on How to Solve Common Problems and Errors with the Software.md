# How to Install and Activate Gambit 2.4.6 with License 260
 
Gambit is a software for geometry design and mesh generation that can be used as an input for Fluent, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver. Gambit is no longer being developed or supported by ANSYS, but it is still a popular tool for many CFD users who are comfortable with its interface and capabilities[^5^]. However, installing and activating Gambit 2.4.6 on Windows can be tricky, especially if you need a specific license number such as 260. In this article, we will show you how to install and activate Gambit 2.4.6 with license 260 on Windows 10.
 
## Step 1: Download Gambit 2.4.6 and Exceed 13
 
Gambit 2.4.6 requires Exceed 13, a software that provides a Unix environment on Windows, to run properly[^7^]. You can download Gambit 2.4.6 and Exceed 13 from the links provided in the comments section of this YouTube video[^8^]. Alternatively, you can also download them from other sources such as Rahim Soft[^6^] or CFD Online[^1^], but make sure they are compatible with your system and virus-free.

## Step 2: Install Exceed 13
 
After downloading Exceed 13, run the setup file and follow the instructions to install it on your computer. You can choose the default options or customize them according to your preferences. You do not need to activate Exceed 13 as it is already cracked.
 
## Step 3: Install Gambit 2.4.6
 
After installing Exceed 13, run the setup file for Gambit 2.4.6 and follow the instructions to install it on your computer. You can choose the default options or customize them according to your preferences. You do not need to enter any serial number or license key during the installation process.
 
## Step 4: Copy the License File
 
After installing Gambit 2.4.6, you need to copy the license file that matches your license number (in this case, 260) to the installation folder of Gambit 2.4.6. You can find the license file in the folder named "license" that comes with the download of Gambit 2.4.6. The license file for license number 260 is named "license.dat". Copy this file and paste it in the folder "C:\Program Files\ANSYS Inc\v145\fluent\ntbin\win64" (or wherever you installed Gambit 2.4.6).
 
## Step 5: Set the Environment Variables
