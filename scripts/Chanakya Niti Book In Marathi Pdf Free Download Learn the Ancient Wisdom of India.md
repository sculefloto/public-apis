## Who was Chanakya and why is he important?
 
Chanakya was one of the most influential thinkers and teachers in ancient India. He was born in a Brahmin family in the 4th century BC, and he studied at the famous Takshashila University, where he mastered various branches of knowledge. He was also well-versed in the Vedas, the ancient scriptures of Hinduism.
 
Chanakya's fame and fortune came when he met Chandragupta Maurya, a young prince who was destined to become the founder of the Mauryan Empire, the first pan-Indian empire in history. Chanakya recognized Chandragupta's potential and decided to mentor him and help him overthrow the Nanda dynasty, which was ruling over most of northern India at that time. Chanakya used his cunning and intelligence to devise various schemes and strategies to defeat the Nandas and their allies, such as the Greek invaders led by Alexander the Great.
