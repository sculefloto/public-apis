LightTools 8 64 bit is the latest release of LightTools, which offers many new features and enhancements to improve your productivity and design quality. Some of the highlights include:
 
- Freeform optical design: You can now design complex freeform surfaces and lenses using a new interactive tool that lets you manipulate the shape of the surface by dragging control points. You can also optimize the freeform surface to meet your performance goals using LightTools' powerful optimization engine.
- Interoperability with CODE V: You can now import and export lens data between LightTools and CODE V, a leading software for imaging optics design. This allows you to leverage the strengths of both tools for your optical system design.
- SmartStart library: You can now access a library of materials and media commonly used in the design of optical systems, such as refractive index and absorption data, volume scatter and BSDF materials. This can save you time and reduce costs by eliminating the need to create or search for these data.
