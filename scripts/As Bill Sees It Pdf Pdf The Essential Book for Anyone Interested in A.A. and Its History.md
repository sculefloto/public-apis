As Bill Sees It is not meant to be a comprehensive or authoritative guide to A.A., but rather a personal reflection of Bill's experience and insight. As he wrote in the foreword: "This volume includes several hundred excerpts from our literature, touching nearly every aspect of A.A.'s way of life. An index subject to this material will enable you quickly to find what you need. But it is not only a reference book; it is one that can be read from cover to cover for it was so designed."
 
As Bill Sees It is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about the history, philosophy, and practice of A.A. It is also a source of hope and encouragement for those who are struggling with alcoholism or other addictions. As Bill wrote: "May this book help you toward your own spiritual awakening!"
  
One of the main themes of As Bill Sees It is the importance of emotional sobriety, which Bill defined as "the ability to find happiness and contentment in life without depending on alcohol or other substances." Bill recognized that many alcoholics, even after achieving physical sobriety, still suffered from emotional problems such as resentment, fear, guilt, anger, and self-pity. He suggested that the solution to these problems was to practice the principles of A.A. in all aspects of life, such as honesty, humility, service, forgiveness, and faith.
 
Another theme of As Bill Sees It is the role of spirituality in recovery. Bill stressed that A.A. was not a religious organization, but rather a spiritual one. He wrote: "We are not allied with any particular faith, sect or denomination, nor do we oppose anyone. We simply wish to be helpful to those who are afflicted." He also emphasized that each A.A. member was free to choose his or her own conception of a Higher Power, as long as it was loving and caring. He believed that by developing a conscious contact with this Higher Power through prayer and meditation, alcoholics could find the strength and guidance they needed to overcome their addiction.
 
A third theme of As Bill Sees It is the value of service and fellowship in A.A. Bill explained that A.A. was not just a program of personal recovery, but also a way of life that involved helping others who suffered from alcoholism. He wrote: "Our very lives, as ex-problem drinkers, depend upon our constant thought of others and how we may help meet their needs." He also described how A.A. members formed a worldwide community of mutual support and understanding, where they could share their experience, strength and hope with each other. He wrote: "We are like the passengers of a great liner the moment after rescue from shipwreck when camaraderie, joyousness and democracy pervade the vessel from steerage to Captain's table."
