The five escapees face many obstacles and dangers on their way to the border. They are chased by Pakistani soldiers, attacked by a group of militants, betrayed by a local guide, and wounded by landmines. They also witness the atrocities committed by both sides of the war on innocent civilians. Along the way, they bond with each other and develop a sense of camaraderie and patriotism.
 
Meanwhile, in India, Major Singh's wife and Captain Kabir's fiancÃƒÂ©e are anxiously waiting for their return. They are unaware of their escape plan and hope that they will be released soon. They also face harassment and discrimination from some of their neighbors and relatives who accuse them of being traitors or cowards.
 
The film culminates in a thrilling climax where the five escapees manage to reach the border with the help of a sympathetic Pakistani truck driver. However, they are confronted by Shakoor and his men who open fire on them. In a heroic sacrifice, Ram drives the truck towards the Pakistani soldiers, killing himself and most of them. The remaining four cross the border and are greeted by Indian soldiers who salute them. The film ends with a voice-over narration that states that more than 50,000 Indian POWs are still missing or unaccounted for.

Some of the critics who reviewed the film positively are:

- Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times, who called it "an appropriately matter-of-fact title for a decidedly low-key documentary. But don't mistake a lack of flash for an absence of substance."[^1^]
- Kate Muir of Times (UK), who wrote that "1971 is a fascinating documentary that unearths the human story behind a burglary of the FBI offices in Media, Pennsylvania, when every secret file was stolen."[^2^]
- Leslie Felperin of Guardian, who said that "Well worth seeking out, especially for anyone with an interest in activism and counterculture history."[^3^]

However, not everyone was impressed by the film. Some of the negative reviews are:

- David Parkinson of Radio Times, who criticized the film for being "too reliant on talking heads and archive footage to generate much dramatic tension."[^4^]
- A critic from Rediff.com, who found the film "too slow and boring" and felt that "the director fails to capture the emotions of the characters or the audience."
- A user from IMDb, who gave the film a rating of 1 out of 10 and commented that "This movie is a waste of time and money. It is full of lies and propaganda. The Indian army was not heroic but brutal and cowardly. The Pakistani army was not evil but noble and brave. The film is an insult to history and humanity."
