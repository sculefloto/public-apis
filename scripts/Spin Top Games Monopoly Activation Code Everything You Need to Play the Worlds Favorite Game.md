Part 2 Tips and Tricks to Win Monopoly Download Article
 
If you want to have an edge over your opponents in Monopoly, you need to know some tips and tricks that can help you improve your strategy and increase your chances of winning. Here are some of the best tips and tricks to win Monopoly:
 
- Always place bets on â2 Rollsâ and â4 Rollsâ when you wager. These are the segments that trigger the bonus round, where you can win big multipliers on your bet. The bonus round is where most of the excitement and money is in Monopoly Live, so you don't want to miss out on it. [^3^]
- Build fast and early. One of the keys to winning in Monopoly is to build your properties as quickly as possible. Thoughtful strategy is important, but too much caution will hamper your chances of winning. There's no point in sitting back and building one house at a time. You want to create monopolies and put up hotels as soon as you can afford them. [^4^]
- Stick to three houses on each property. This may sound contradictory to the previous tip, but there is a good reason for it. Once you've reached three houses, the amount that the rent increases for each house maxes out. If you want to use your money wisely, stick to just three houses. You can use the extra cash to buy more properties or trade with other players. [^2^]
- Avoid Park Lane and Mayfair. These are the most expensive properties in the game, but they are also the least landed-on. The reason is that they are far away from Jail, which is the most landed-on square in the game. You are better off investing in cheaper properties that have higher traffic and return on investment. [^1^]
- Aim for the oranges, blues, reds or yellows. These are the best properties to own in Monopoly, as they have a high frequency of landing and a good balance of cost and rent. The oranges are especially valuable, as they are the most landed-on group in the game. The blues are cheap and easy to develop, while the reds and yellows offer higher rents for moderate prices. [^1^]

By following these tips and tricks, you can improve your chances of winning Monopoly and becoming a real estate tycoon.
