### How to Create a New Project
 
A project is a collection of files and settings that define your civil engineering design. To create a new project, follow these steps:

1. Launch AutoCAD Civil 3D Land Desktop Companion 2009 from your Start menu or desktop shortcut.
2. On the Application menu, click New Project.
3. In the New Project dialog box, enter a name and a description for your project.
4. Select a template and a coordinate system for your project. A template contains predefined settings and styles that can be applied to your project. A coordinate system defines the location and orientation of your project on the earth's surface.
5. Click OK to create your project. A new drawing will open with the default settings and styles of your template.

### How to Import Points
 
Points are locations in your project that have coordinates and elevations. You can use points to define features such as boundaries, contours, alignments, and profiles. To import points from a text file, follow these steps:

1. In your drawing, click Points menu > Import/Export Points > Import Points.
2. In the Import Points dialog box, click Browse and select the text file that contains the point data. The text file should have one point per line, with the point number, easting, northing, and elevation separated by commas or spaces.
3. Click OK to import the points. The points will be displayed in your drawing with labels and symbols.

### How to Create Contours
 
Contours are lines that connect points of equal elevation. You can use contours to represent the shape and slope of the terrain in your project. To create contours from points, follow these steps:

1. In your drawing, click Surface menu > Create Surface From Points.
2. In the Create Surface From Points dialog box, enter a name and a description for your surface.
3. Select the points that you want to use for creating the surface. You can select individual points or use filters to select points by number, description, layer, or elevation range.
4. Click OK to create the surface. The surface will be displayed in your drawing as a wireframe model.
5. To display contours on the surface, click Surface menu > Edit Surface Style.
6. In the Edit Surface Style dialog box, click the Contours tab.
7. Select the contour intervals and colors that you want to use for your surface. You can also adjust other settings such as linetype, layer, label style, and annotation scale.
8. Click OK to apply the contour style to your surface. The contours will be displayed on your surface in your drawing.
