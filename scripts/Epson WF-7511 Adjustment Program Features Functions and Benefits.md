If you own an Epson WF-7511 printer, you may encounter a problem where the printer stops working and displays an error message like "A printer's ink pad is at the end of its service life. Please contact Epson Support." This means that the waste ink pad counter has reached its limit and needs to be reset.
 
The waste ink pad is a part of the printer that absorbs excess ink during printing, cleaning, and maintenance. When the waste ink pad becomes full, the printer stops working to prevent ink from overflowing and damaging the printer or the surrounding area.
