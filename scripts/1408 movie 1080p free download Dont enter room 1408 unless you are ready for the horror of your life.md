It was also a box-office success, earning nearly five times its production budget of $25 million.
 
If you are looking for a thrilling and terrifying movie experience, then you should watch 1408. But be warned: once you enter 1408, there is no turning back.

1408 has two different endings, depending on which version of the film you watch. The theatrical version has a more hopeful ending, while the director's cut has a darker one.
 
In the theatrical version, Mike manages to set off the sprinkler system in the room, causing a fire that destroys 1408. He is rescued by the firefighters and taken to a hospital, where he reunites with his wife Lily. He also receives a package from Olin, containing a tape recorder with the voice of his deceased daughter Katie, who died of cancer. Mike plays the tape for Lily, proving that he was not hallucinating and that 1408 was indeed haunted.
 
In the director's cut, Mike also sets off the sprinkler system, but it is too late to save him. He dies in the fire and his body is taken to a morgue. Lily arrives at the hotel and is given Mike's belongings by Olin, including the tape recorder. She plays the tape and hears Katie's voice, but also Mike's voice saying "We've only just begun", implying that he is still trapped in 1408's hell. The film ends with a shot of 1408 being restored to its original state, ready for its next victim.
 
Which ending do you prefer? Do you think 1408 is one of the best Stephen King adaptations? Let us know in the comments below.

1408 is not just a horror film, but also a psychological drama that explores the themes of grief, guilt, and redemption. Mike is a broken man who has lost his faith in life and in himself after the death of his daughter. He uses his work as a way to escape from his pain and to mock the supernatural, which he considers a fraud. He is also estranged from his wife, who still loves him but cannot reach him.
 
However, when he enters 1408, he is forced to confront his demons and his past. The room is a manifestation of his subconscious, which torments him with visions of his daughter, his father, and his own failures. The room also challenges his rationality and his sanity, making him doubt everything he sees and hears. Mike has to find a way to overcome his fear and his sorrow, and to reconnect with his wife and his daughter.
 
1408 is a film that will make you think and feel. It is a film that will scare you and move you. It is a film that will stay with you long after it ends.
