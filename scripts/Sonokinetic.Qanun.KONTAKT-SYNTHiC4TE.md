## What is Sonokinetic Qanun?
  
Sonokinetic Qanun is a Kontakt library that features a multisampled and performance-sampled Qanun instrument. The Qanun (also known as Qanoun and Kanun) is a dulcimer or zither-like instrument of 81 strings stretched over a frame and plucked with the fingers or picks. Its distinctive tone comes from the grouping of strings and levers which create the scales.
  
The library was recorded in Istanbul by expert engineer and composer Ceyda Pirali in high fidelity audio quality. The player is the renowned performer Gunay Celik who learnt his craft at the State Turkish Music Conservatory. He studied the playing styles and techniques for many years before becoming a master in 1992. He taught Qanun at university level and has played with the Ä°stanbul University Ensemble and Ayangil Turkish Music Orchestra. His credits also include many performances with Turkish radio and television.
  
The library contains over 23.000 samples and covers five different playing/finger styles: thumbs, fingertips, picks, picks on bridge and pizzicato. It also includes various articulations such as tremolo, harmonics, vibrato made by moving pegs fast, fisme on press, fiske on release and an assortment of sound FX. It also features four types of bending pegs in both ascending and descending fashion and both half- and whole tone.
  
The library also comes with an intuitive interface that allows you to control various parameters such as volume, pan, tuning, microtuning, reverb, delay, EQ and more. You can also switch between different playing modes such as chromatic mode, performance mode and keyswitch mode. The library also supports NKS integration for seamless compatibility with Native Instruments hardware.
